Hello! My name is Razak and I enjoy creating things that live on the
internet. I started programming about six years ago in python. I really
enjoyed building websites with flask and django. I also enjoyed creating
automation and web scraping scripts with my python knowledge.


Nowadays, I write backends with node and express. Although I enjoy backend
development, I am also a competent frontend developer with react and
typescript. I also have experience with docker and postgresql.
